# Kudzu

Kudzu is a configurable RISC-V soft-core for [Torii] HDL based designs. It's designed to support most if not all of the RISC-V specification with extensions for both 32 and 64 bit core variants, including multi-hart configurations.

For more information, see the [Introduction], and check out the [Getting Started] guide for how to quickly get up and running with Kudzu.

## Community

The two primary community spots for Torii and by extension Kudzu are the `#torii` IRC channel on [libera.chat] (`irc.libera.chat:6697`) which you can join via your favorite IRC client or the [web chat], and the [discussion forum] on GitHub.

Please do join and share your projects using Kudzu, ask questions, get help with problems, or discuss development.

We also maintain a list of [projects using Kudzu], so post it in the [show and tell] section of the [discussion forum] and we'll add it!
